## SDK Usage Example

```ruby
# Implementation example of handling the `emailNotificationCallback` event (with signature verification) in Rails.

require 'rails'
require 'action_controller/railtie'
require 'webhooks_and_callbacks_api'

include WebhooksAndCallbacksApi

# Define route
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  post '/webhooks/receive', to: 'webhooks#receive'
end

# Define controller
class WebhooksController < ActionController::API
  def receive
    # Step 1: Create the handler using your shared secret key.
    handler = CallbacksBHandler.new('your-shared-secret')

    # Step 2: Verify and parse the request into a typed event.
    # Use the Rails request directly (Rack::Request compatible).
    event = handler.verify_and_parse_event(request)

    # Step 3: Pattern match on the event types and handle it.
    if event.is_a?(NotificationCallback) && event.notification_type == 'email'
      puts 'EmailNotificationCallback received'
      # TODO: Add emailnotificationcallback handling
    elsif event.is_a?(SignatureVerificationFailure)
      puts 'Signature verification failure received'
      # TODO: Add signature verification failure handling
    elsif event.is_a?(UnknownEvent)
      puts 'Unknown event received'
      # TODO: Add unknown event handling
    else
      puts 'default received'
      # TODO: Add default handling
    end

    # Step 4: Return 200 OK to acknowledge receipt.
    head :ok
  end
end
```
