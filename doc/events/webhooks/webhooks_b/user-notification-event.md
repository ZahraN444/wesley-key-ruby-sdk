# User Notification Event

Triggered when user-related notifications occur

## Signature Verification

This event uses the `HMAC Signature Verifier` for request verification. The event includes an `X-Webhook-Signature` header that will be validated using your shared `secret-key` to ensure request authenticity.

## Headers

This event's request contains the following headers.

| Name |
|  --- |
| Content-Type |

## Payload Type

This event's request payload is of type [UserActionNotificationEvent | UserStatusNotificationEvent | UserPreferenceNotificationEvent](../../../../doc/models/containers/user-notification-event-body.md).

## Payload Example

```json
{
  "userActionNotificationEventType": "user.action",
  "exampleAdditionalProperty": {
    "key1": "val1",
    "key2": "val2"
  }
}
```

## SDK Usage Example

```ruby
# Implementation example of handling the `userNotificationEvent` event (with signature verification) in Rails.

require 'rails'
require 'action_controller/railtie'
require 'webhooks_and_callbacks_api'

include WebhooksAndCallbacksApi

# Define route
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  post '/webhooks/receive', to: 'webhooks#receive'
end

# Define controller
class WebhooksController < ActionController::API
  def receive
    # Step 1: Create the handler using your shared secret key.
    handler = WebhooksBHandler.new('your-shared-secret')

    # Step 2: Verify and parse the request into a typed event.
    # Use the Rails request directly (Rack::Request compatible).
    event = handler.verify_and_parse_event(request)

    # Step 3: Pattern match on the event types and handle it.
    if event.is_a?(UserActionNotificationEvent) || event.is_a?(UserStatusNotificationEvent) || event.is_a?(UserPreferenceNotificationEvent)
      puts 'UserNotificationEvent received'
      # TODO: Add usernotificationevent handling
    elsif event.is_a?(SignatureVerificationFailure)
      puts 'Signature verification failure received'
      # TODO: Add signature verification failure handling
    elsif event.is_a?(UnknownEvent)
      puts 'Unknown event received'
      # TODO: Add unknown event handling
    else
      puts 'default received'
      # TODO: Add default handling
    end

    # Step 4: Return 200 OK to acknowledge receipt.
    head :ok
  end
end
```
